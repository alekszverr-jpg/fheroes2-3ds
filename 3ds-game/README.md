# fheroes2 Nintendo 3DS game build

## High-resolution top screen — preview 0.3.5

Hold **R**, then press **Start** to switch 400×240 ↔ **800×240 in 2D**. The choice is saved immediately in `fheroes2.cfg` as `3ds high resolution = on/off`; new installations default to off. Stereo 3D is not enabled. Narrower physical pixels preserve the proportions and framing of the 800×480 game frame. Native top-screen information retains its readable size; the lower screen stays at 320×240. Old 2DS and failed model detection use standard output.

Test on real hardware: compare fine map details, viewport borders, information and chest windows, then combat. R + Start inside a dialog must not confirm an answer. Restart to check the saved preference. Physical wide-mode quality and performance are pending validation.

Preview **0.3.5** builds the fheroes2 engine and game for Homebrew Launcher. See [installation and controls](INSTALL.md), the [root README](../README.md) for build instructions, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for editing the engine patch.

The renderer presents an 800×480 indexed game frame as a full 400×240 overview on the top screen and a native-scale detail viewport on the touchscreen. Circle Pad and stylus control the cursor and detail viewport; the D-pad scrolls the adventure map. Y toggles a touchscreen strip using the original adventure command icons.

The build entry point in `CMakeLists.txt` combines the upstream engine/Smacker targets with game sources, pinned SDL2 and SDL2_mixer, and the local devkitARM toolchain adapter. It preserves the upstream desktop configuration. Platform changes are distributed in `../patches/fheroes2-3ds.patch` against upstream commit `9754feff8501dbb69df95f3b999156a32eb8d7d3`.

`engine_smoke.cpp` checks the platform/engine input and rendering behavior. The menu test also exercises command-strip selection and map scrolling on a synthetic world. New/Old Azahar checks passed; preview 0.3.5 still needs physical hardware validation. Previous previews were reported working on New 3DS XL for matches, AI, combat and saving/loading.

Preview 0.3.3 routes supported common messages to separate native-resolution images: information on top, answers on the touchscreen. Text wraps at the target screen width; long content scrolls while answer buttons stay fixed. Nested information retains the lower dialog. Closing input is captured and viewport motion is frozen through the modal scope.

Preview 0.3.4 also adapts `Dialog::SelectGoldOrExp` to the touchscreen, reusing the modal input and content-scrolling code. Gold/Experience buttons, reward icons and amounts, current kingdom gold and experience needed for the next level stay fixed. Holding a reward icon or B on the selected option opens information above. The original boolean return and reward-granting caller remain unchanged: Gold is true, Experience is false; L still chooses Experience.

Army/monster information, recruitment and custom interactive elements retain their original paths. These specialized windows and battle commands are the next UI work. Stereo 3D is a later experiment. Detailed historical notes and plans remain available in [Russian](README_RU.md).
