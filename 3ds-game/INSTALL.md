[Русский](INSTALL_RU.md) | [Project and downloads](https://github.com/alekszverr-jpg/fheroes2-3ds)

## Installation

1. Download `fheroes2-menu-preview-0.3.2.zip` from the [release page](https://github.com/alekszverr-jpg/fheroes2-3ds/releases/tag/v0.3.2).
2. Extract its `3ds` directory to the root of the console's SD card.
3. Add the original Heroes of Might and Magic II files from your own game installation to the directories below. The release does not include original game data, maps or music.
4. Launch **fheroes2 3DS preview** from Homebrew Launcher.

/3ds/fheroes2/data/heroes2.agg
/3ds/fheroes2/data/heroes2x.agg       (if supplied with your edition)
/3ds/fheroes2/maps/                 (your original map files)
/3ds/fheroes2/music/TrackXX.ogg      (optional external music)
/3ds/fheroes2/files/data/resurrection.h2d
/3ds/fheroes2/files/lang/ru.mo
```

Copy the contents of your original `Data` and `Maps` directories into `data` and `maps`. For supported GOG `Tracks2` files, the preparation script renames `02-AudioTrack…ogg` to `Track02.ogg`, and similarly for the other tracks. External music is optional. Sound and long sessions still need separate hardware testing.

When updating, back up your saves and configuration. Replace the application and bundled `files` resources, keeping your existing `fheroes2.cfg`, original resources and saves. When updating specifically from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2, replacing `fheroes2.3dsx` is sufficient.

New installations use English. Choose Russian in the game's language settings; its translation is bundled. Existing language settings remain yours. Intro videos are skipped on 3DS. The log is written to `/3ds/fheroes2/fheroes2.log`.

## Screens and controls

The top screen shows the full 800×480 game frame at a uniform half scale, filling 400×240 pixels. The adventure map gains 160 pixels of width while the original panels and sprites keep their proportions. A red rectangle marks the area shown below. Stereo 3D is not implemented.

The touchscreen shows a 320×240 detail viewport at the game's native scale. It follows the Circle Pad cursor and the stylus smoothly, with a central dead zone to reduce unwanted movement. Dragging the stylus moves this detail viewport without dragging the adventure map. After a drag, lift the stylus and tap again to click.

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Circle Pad | Move the mouse cursor |
| R | Speed up cursor movement |
| A | Left mouse button |
| B, held | Right mouse button / information |
| Short stylus tap | Left click |
| Stationary stylus hold, 550 ms | Right-button information; release does not cause a left click |
| D-pad on the adventure map | Scroll the map continuously; two directions scroll diagonally |
| Y on the adventure map | Show or hide the bottom command strip |
| Start | Enter / confirm |
| L | Escape / back |
| X | End-turn shortcut |
| Select | File-menu shortcut |

D-pad map scrolling uses the game's scroll-speed setting and stops on release. Opposite directions cancel each other. It stops a moving hero first. Menus, dialogs and battles retain the existing button handling; a held map direction is cancelled on entering a dialog and requires a fresh press afterwards.

## Bottom command strip

Press Y on the adventure map to display eight original 40×40 command icons along the bottom edge. From left to right: next hero, move/revisit, kingdom overview, spells, end turn, adventure actions, file menu and settings.

Tap an icon to run its command. Hold it still for 550 ms to show information, including for disabled commands. Moving 10 pixels or leaving the pressed icon cancels the action. Strip touches do not issue commands to the map underneath. Ending a turn through the strip always requires confirmation.

The detail viewport becomes 320×200 while the strip is visible. The strip hides during dialogs, battles and AI turns. Visibility is remembered during the current application session, but is not yet saved between launches.

## Current validation and limitations

Earlier previews have been tested on a physical New Nintendo 3DS XL: entering a match, AI turns, battles, saving/loading and the 0.3.1 command strip were reported working. Preview 0.3.2 passed New/Old Azahar checks for input, viewport boundaries, command-strip routing and real map scrolling on a synthetic map. These automated checks do not exercise a full match.

The 800×480 frame and D-pad changes still need physical-console validation. Physical Old 3DS compatibility, audio and long-session stability are unverified. Informational popups on the top screen and interactive dialogs on the bottom screen are planned; this release still uses the existing game dialogs.

For a hardware report, include your console model, map/scenario, reproduction steps and `/3ds/fheroes2/fheroes2.log`.
